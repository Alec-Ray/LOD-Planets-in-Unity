# LOD-Planets-in-Unity

0. Drag all the scirpts into Unity.
1. Put the Planet.cs script on an empty game object.
2. Put the GameManagement.cs and Presets.cs scripts on another game object.
3. Tweak the settings (everything SHOULD be available in the inspector, but check the scripts to be sure).

Enjoy :)
